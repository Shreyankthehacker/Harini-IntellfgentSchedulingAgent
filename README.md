# Harini - Fast and Intelligent Scheduling Assistant 


Harini is an intelligent, conversational appointment booking assistant designed to seamlessly handle the end-to-end scheduling process for individuals and professionals. Built with cutting-edge AI, Harini understands user intent through natural conversations and takes care of booking, confirming, and managing appointments in real time.

With deep integration into Google Calendar, Harini checks your availability, avoids conflicts, and intelligently finds open time slots based on both user preferences and calendar constraints. Once a suitable slot is identified, Harini not only creates the calendar event but also automatically sends personalized email confirmations to all participants.

What sets Harini apart is her proactive communication — after scheduling, she can also initiate a phone call to confirm the appointment, providing a human-like follow-up experience that boosts reliability and trust.
